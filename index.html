Emma Dupont never expected to become the most feared and revered food critic in all of Nevada, but life has a funny way of steering you torwards your destiny. Growing up dirt poor in a town so small that it didn’t even have a stoplight, she spent most of her childhood watching her mother transform basic ingredients into French masterpieces in their tiny kitchen. Coq au vin on a Tuesday? Absolutely. Bouillabaisse in the dead of winter when the grocery store was an hour away? 
<p>
Somehow, she made it happen. Emma’s stomach (and soul) were molded by these meals, even when money was so tight that their only protein some weeks came from the neighbor’s generosity or an overly ambitious fishing trip.
Despite her culinary upbringing, Emma’s first career had nothing to do with food—unless you count delivering it. She took a job as a seafood truck driver, hauling fresh shrimp, scallops, and catfish to restaurants across the state. It was grueling work, but it came with one major perk: every day, she found herself in a new town, parked outside a restaurant she’d never tried before.
<p>
It started innocently enough. A Yelp review here, a snarky comment about rubbery scallops there. But her talent for describing food—vivid, sharp, and hilarious—began gaining traction. Soon, her blog, "Highway to Haute Cuisine," became a local sensation. Restaurants whispered her name in kitchens. Owners checked their plating twice when they saw a woman in work boots and a flannel eyeing their menu. She might not have looked like your typical food critic, but she had the taste buds of a Michelin inspector and the writing chops of someone who knew how to turn a good meal into a great story.
<p>
Now, Emma’s days of truck driving are behind her, replaced by a career she never saw coming. She’s paid to travel, invited to secret tastings, and sought after by restaurants dreaming of a Michelin star. She still approaches every meal with a mix of reverence and brutal honesty—because good food deserves both. Whether it’s a hole-in-the-wall diner serving the best gumbo this side of New Orleans or a high-end establishment attempting to deconstruct a cassoulet into foam, Emma calls it like she tastes it.
<p>
And the best part? She still keeps her mom’s old recipes on hand, just in case she needs to remind a chef what real French cooking is supposed to taste like.
Of course, not everyone loves Emma’s no-nonsense approach. She’s received her fair share of angry emails from chefs who didn’t appreciate her brutally honest reviews. One particularly fiery response from a restaurant owner in the capital accused her of "culinary terrorism." Emma laughed so hard she nearly choked on a croissant. But she stands by her philosophy: great food should be accessible, passionate, and, above all, delicious.
Her growing reputation has also brought its share of unexpected perks. Once, a small bakery in a remote town recognized her and refused to let her pay for her meal. The elderly owner told Emma that her glowing review of their apple tarte Tatin had tripled their weekend business. Moments like those, more than any paycheck, remind Emma why she does what she does.
<p>
Emma Dupont had been to every backroad diner, roadside BBQ pit, and hole-in-the-wall eatery in the state, but there was one place she hadn’t yet ventured—a small, unnamed restaurant buried deep in the pine-choked backroads of the countryside. It had no Yelp page, no social media presence, just a whisper among chefs and foodies: “If you find it, you’ll never forget it.” 
<p>
That should have been her first warning.
<p>
The drive was long and lonely, the GPS losing signal an hour before she even saw the first hand-painted sign: "FOOD – NEXT RIGHT." The second warning was the parking lot—empty except for a few mud-splattered trucks and a rusted-out station wagon. The third was the restaurant itself, an unassuming clapboard building with no windows, just a flickering neon sign that buzzed weakly in the damp air.
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of roasted meat and something darker underneath, like pennies left too long in the sun. A single server, a gaunt woman with hollow eyes and an apron that looked more like a butcher's smock, led Emma to a table in the center of the room.
<p>
“We already have your meal ready,” the woman murmured before disappearing into the kitchen.
Emma frowned. No menu? No choice? But the thrill of an undiscovered culinary experience kept her seated.
When the dish arrived, it was unlike anything she had ever seen—deep, rich cuts of meat seared to perfection, resting in a pool of glistening sauce. The aroma was intoxicating, primal. She took her first bite, and the world around her seemed to vanish. The meat melted on her tongue, a perfect balance of umami and something almost… familiar. It was exquisite.
<p>
Too exquisite.
<p>
Then the kitchen door swung open, and out stepped a man in a stained apron, wiping his hands with a rag. His smile was wide, unnatural. “You like it?” he asked, his voice thick with amusement.
Emma swallowed hard. Something was wrong. The texture, the taste… realization clawed its way up her throat. She had been drugged, and had only moments of conciusness left.  The man chuckled, watching her reaction like a scientist observing a test subject. “We only serve the finest cuts here,” he said. “Locally sourced.” Then everything faded to black.
<p>
Her stomach churned as she looked around. She could feel the cold concrete floor and the iron shackle tethering her to the wall. The silence was terrible and her head throbbed. The thick, iron scent that had lingered in the air since she woke up.
<p>
She had eaten a lot of things in her career. But never had she tried... whatever that was.
<p>
Panic surged through her veins, but before she could move, strong hands clamped down on her shoulders. The gaunt server now had a vice grip on her, her fingernails digging into Emma’s skin.
“You wont be leaving yet,” the woman whispered. Emma struggled, heart pounding, but the man simply sighed. “Don’t fight. You’ll ruin your digestion.”
She had been dragged into the back and through the kitchen could see metal tables slick with fresh blood. The stench was overpowering. The truth of it all—what had been simmering in those pots, what had been hanging in the cold storage—made her gag. There was a corpse of a young man hanging upside down, half butchered.
<p>
A plate set in front of her once more. A new dish. Redder. Thicker. “Eat,” the woman commanded. Tears streamed down her face as she shook her head. “You will eat, and you will review or you'll be the next main course.” She gestured toward a heavy steel door. A muffled cry echoed from behind it.
<p>
Emma had no choice.
<p>
She lifted the fork with trembling fingers and took another bite. The taste was indescribable, horrific, sublime. And the worst part—the absolute worst part—was that some dark, primal part of her liked it.
<p>
When they finally let her go, several hours and several courses later, stumbling into the cold night, she realized she would never escape what had happened. 
<p>
Years later she would write a review which she shared with no one. She did keep it in the back of her bottom dresser drawer and would glance at it from time to time. The hunger had been planted inside her. Although she was free, she would never stop craving the taste.
